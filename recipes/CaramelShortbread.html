    <h2><em>Description:</em></h2>
    <p>Make caramel shortbread (aka millionaire's shortbread) with this easy recipe.</p>
    <p>With a buttery shortbread crust, a firm caramel center,
    and a dreamy milk chocolate topping, these squares are so rich you'll
    want to cut them small!</p>

    <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
    <h3>Shortbread:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅔ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Caramel:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chocolate Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C).</li>
        <li>Make the shortbread: Mix flour, softened butter,
        and sugar together in a medium bowl until well blended and crumbly.
        Press into the bottom of a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dry and light golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the caramel: Bring butter, brown sugar, condensed milk,
        and corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Boil for 5 minutes,
        then remove from the heat and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon for about
        3 minutes. Pour over baked crust (crust can be either warm or cool).
        Let sit at room temperature until caramel begins to firm up, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Microwave chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl on high for 1 minute,
        then stir and continue to heat and stir in 20-second intervals until chocolate
        is melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour chocolate over caramel layer and spread evenly to cover completely.
        Chill in the refrigerator until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.
        Cut into 1-inch squares.</li>
    </ol>
