    <h2><em>Description:</em></h2>
    <p>With a rich, nutty flavor from finely chopped pecans, and a sweet, 
    powdery coating from confectioners' sugar, these tiny, 
    buttery treats are truly the most delicious melt-in-your-mouth morsels.</p>
    <p>These snowball cookies are simply irresistible. It's sure to become a go-to during the holiday season,
    but you'll want to make this snowball cookie recipe all year long.</p>

    <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        Place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar,
        and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. 
        Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until completely incorporated.
        Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale,
        12 to 15 minutes. (Try not to let cookies get too brown:
        it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)</li>
        <li>Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking
        sheets briefly before removing to wire racks.</li>
        <li>Roll hot cookies in the reserved powdered sugar to coat,
        then return to the wire racks to cool. Once cooled,
        roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.</li>
    </ol>
